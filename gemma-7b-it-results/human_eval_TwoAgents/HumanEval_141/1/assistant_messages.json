Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n**Imports:**\n\n- `run_tests` function from `my_tests` module is imported.\n\n**Function Definition:**\n\n- `file_name_check` function takes a string `file_name` as input.\n- The function checks if the file name is valid based on the following conditions:\n    - No more than three digits in the file name.\n    - Exactly one dot in the file name.\n    - Substring before the dot starts with a letter from the Latin alphabet.\n    - Substring after the dot is one of the extensions `['txt', 'exe', 'dll']`.\n\n**Test Execution:**\n\n- `run_tests(file_name_check)` function is called to run the unit tests.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The code assumes that the `valid_file_name` function is defined in the `my_tests` module.\n- The code does not handle the case where the file name is not valid.\n- The code does not handle the case where the file name is too long.\n- The code does not handle the case where the file name contains special characters.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis code is a good example of how to use the `run_tests` function and define a function to check file name validity. It is well-structured and easy to understand. However, there are some potential improvements that could be made to handle more edge cases.",
