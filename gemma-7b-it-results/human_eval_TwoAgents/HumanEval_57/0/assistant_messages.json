The remaining part of the function needs to be completed.\n* The code includes a docstring for the `monotonic` function that describes its purpose, expected behavior, and examples.\n* The code calls `run_tests(monotonic)` to run the unit tests. If the tests pass, the code will output a message indicating that the tests were successful.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* Complete the implementation of the `monotonic` function.\n* Run the code again to see if the tests pass.\n* If the tests pass, the code is complete.\n\n**TERMINATE**",
