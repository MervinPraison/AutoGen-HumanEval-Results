The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `words_in_sentence`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `words_in_sentence`. However, `words_in_sentence` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `words_in_sentence` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(words_in_sentence)`, as well as words_in_sentence's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

    Example 1:
        Input: sentence = "This is a test"
        Output: "is"

    Example 2:
        Input: sentence = "lets go for swimming"
        Output: "go for"

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
        * sentence contains only letters

## Python Code

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """

        * sentence contains only letters
    """

    # Complete this function
    # The code below is incomplete and needs to be finished

    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()

    # Filter out words whose length is not prime
    prime_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]

    # Join the prime words into a new string
    return " ".join(prime_words)


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(words_in_sentence)
```

## Explanation

This code imports the `run_tests` function from the `my_tests` module and calls it with the `words_in_sentence` function as an argument. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the correct implementation of `words_in_sentence`.

The `words_in_sentence` function is still incomplete. The code below the docstring is missing. To complete the function, you need to fill in the code that splits the sentence into words, filters out words whose length is not prime, and joins the remaining words into a new string.

The code also includes a `print` statement to output the result of the function.

Once you have completed the code, you can run the tests by executing the following command:

```
python my_script.py
```

If the tests pass, the output should be:

```
PASSED
```

If the tests fail, the output will list the errors. You can then fix the code and run the tests again until they pass.

## Explanation of the code:

This code is a Python script that aims to find all the words in a sentence whose length is prime. It uses the `run_tests` function from the `my_tests` module to run a set of automated unit tests for the function `words_in_sentence`.

**Here is a breakdown of the code:**

**1. Import Libraries:**

```python
from my_tests import run_tests
```

The `my_tests` module contains a function called `run_tests` that is used to run unit tests.

**2. Define the `words_in_sentence` function:**

```python
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
```

This function takes a string `sentence` as input and returns a string containing all the words in the sentence whose length is prime.

**3. Incomplete code:**

```python
    # Complete this function
    # The code below is incomplete and needs to be finished
```

This section of code is missing the code that splits the sentence into words, filters out words whose length is not prime, and joins the remaining words into a new string.

**4. Print the result:**

```python
    # Print the result
    print("".join(prime_words))
```

This code prints the result of the function, which is a string containing all the words in the sentence whose length is prime.

**5. Run the tests:**

```python
run_tests(words_in_sentence)
```

This line calls the `run_tests` function with the `words_in_sentence` function as an argument. The `run_tests` function will execute the unit tests for the `words_in_sentence` function and report the results.

**Additional notes:**

* The code assumes that the `is_prime` function is defined in the `my_tests` module.
* The code does not handle any error cases, such as invalid input or unexpected errors.
* The code does not include any documentation or comments.

## Summary

This code is a Python script that defines a function called `words_in_sentence` that takes a sentence as input and returns a string containing all the words in the sentence whose length is prime. The code is incomplete and missing the code to split the sentence into words, filter out words whose length is not prime, and join the remaining words into a new string.

**Here are the key takeaways:**

* The code imports the `run_tests` function from the `my_tests` module and calls it with the `words_in_sentence` function as an argument.
* The `words_in_sentence` function is incomplete and needs to be finished.
* The code prints the result of the function, which is a string containing all the words in the sentence whose length is prime.
* The code does not handle any error cases or provide any documentation.
