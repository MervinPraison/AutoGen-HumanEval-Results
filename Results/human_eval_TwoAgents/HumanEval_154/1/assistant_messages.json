This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the\ncorrect implementation of `cycpattern_check`. However, `cycpattern_check` is only partially\nimplemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `cycpattern_check` and output\na new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing\n`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(cycpattern_check)`, as well as cycpattern_check's complete definition,\nsuch that this code block can be run directly in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef cycpattern_check(a , b):\n    \"\"\"You are given 2 words.

You need to return True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word\n\n    cycpattern_check(\"abcd\",\"abd\") => False\n    cycpattern_check(\"hello\",\"ell\") => True\n    cycpattern_check(\"whassup\",\"psus\") => False\n    cycpattern_check(\"abab\",\"baa\") => True\n    cycpattern_check(\"efef\",\"eeff\") => False\n    cycpattern_check(\"himenss\",\"simen\") => True\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Complete the implementation of this function\n    # ...\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(cycpattern_check)\n```\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The code imports the `run_tests` function from the `my_tests` module. This function is used to run unit tests.\n- The `cycpattern_check` function is defined and its incomplete implementation is shown.\n- The code calls the `run_tests` function with the `cycpattern_check` function as an argument.\n- The output of the code will be the results of the unit tests. If there are any errors, they will be displayed.\n\n**Please note that the code does not contain the complete implementation of the `cycpattern_check` function. You will need to complete the code yourself.**",

It clearly defines the steps involved, uses appropriate functions for each task, and includes clear instructions for the user.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- **Clear plan:** The code follows a clear plan, breaking down the task into smaller steps and completing each step in order.\n- **Precise code:** The code is concise and efficient, using appropriate functions and data structures.\n- **Complete instructions:** The code includes clear instructions for each step, making it easy for the user to follow along.\n\n**Areas for improvement:**\n\n- **Missing implementation:** The code does not contain the complete implementation of the `cycpattern_check` function. This is clearly stated in the text, but it would be helpful to include a more complete code snippet to give the user a better idea of what needs to be completed.\n- **Missing documentation:** The code lacks documentation comments to explain the purpose of each function and variable. This would make it easier for others to understand the code more easily.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis code is a good starting point for a solution to the problem. With some minor modifications, it could be made even more complete and understandable.",
