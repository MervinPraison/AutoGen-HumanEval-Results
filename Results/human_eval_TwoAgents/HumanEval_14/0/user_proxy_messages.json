Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n**Imports:**\n\n- `run_tests` function from `my_tests.py` is imported to run the unit tests.\n\n**Function Definition:**\n\n- `all_prefixes` function takes a string `string` as input and returns a list of all prefixes from shortest to longest.\n- The function is incomplete and needs to be completed with the actual logic for extracting prefixes.\n\n**Running Tests:**\n\n- `run_tests(all_prefixes)` is called to run the unit tests for the `all_prefixes` function.\n\n**Output:**\n\n- If the tests pass, the output will show \"All tests passed!\".\n- If there are any errors, the output will show the errors and the code will exit with an error code.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The code includes a docstring for the `all_prefixes` function that describes its purpose and expected behavior.\n- The code also includes a comment explaining the next steps to complete the function.\n\n**Overall, this code is a good starting point for completing the `all_prefixes` function. By filling in the missing code and running the tests, you can complete the function and ensure its functionality.**",
