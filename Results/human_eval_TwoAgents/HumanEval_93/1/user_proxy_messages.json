The remaining part of the function needs to be completed.\n- The code includes a docstring for the `encode` function that describes its purpose, examples, and assumptions.\n- The code does not include any error handling.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- Complete the implementation of the `encode` function.\n- Run the `run_tests` function again to verify that the tests pass.\n- If there are any errors, fix the code and run the tests again until they pass.",

Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n**Imports:**\n\n- `run_tests` function from `my_tests.py` is imported.\n\n**Function Definition:**\n\n- `encode` function is defined with one parameter, `message`.\n- The function docstring describes its purpose, examples, and assumptions.\n\n**Missing Implementation:**\n\n- The remaining part of the `encode` function needs to be completed.\n\n**Testing:**\n\n- The `run_tests` function is called with the `encode` function as an argument.\n- If the tests pass, the script exits with an exit code of 0.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The code lacks error handling.\n- The code does not include any output printing.\n- The code assumes that the `my_tests` module is available.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis code provides a good starting point for completing the `encode` function. It imports the necessary libraries, defines the function, and includes a docstring. The remaining part of the function needs to be completed to make the code functional.",
