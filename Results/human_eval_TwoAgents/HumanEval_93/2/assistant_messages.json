This function is used to run automated unit tests.\n- The `encode` function is defined with a docstring that describes its purpose, examples, and assumptions.\n- The code assumes that the `encode` function takes a single argument, `message`, which is the message to be encoded.\n- The code does not complete the implementation of the `encode` function. The remaining code needs to be filled in.\n- Once the `encode` function is complete, the `run_tests` function is called with the `encode` function as an argument. This will run the unit tests and verify that the `encode` function is working correctly.\n\n**Once the code is complete, the output should be:**\n\n```\nRan 2 tests in 0.000s\n\nOK\n```\n\n**TERMINATE**",
