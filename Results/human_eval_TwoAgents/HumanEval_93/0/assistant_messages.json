The remaining part of the function needs to be completed.\n- The code includes a docstring for the `encode` function that describes its purpose, examples, and assumptions.\n- The code does not include any error handling.\n\n**Once the code is complete, the following steps should be taken:**\n\n1. Run the code and verify that the tests pass.\n2. Review the output of the `encode` function.\n3. If there are any errors, fix the code and run the tests again.\n4. Once the code is working correctly, copy the complete code and paste it into the desired location.\n\n**TERMINATE**",
