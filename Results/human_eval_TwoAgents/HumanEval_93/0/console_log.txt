SCENARIO.PY STARTING !#!#
user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `encode`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `encode`. However, `encode` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `encode` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(encode)`, as well as encode's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def encode(message):
    """
    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a 
    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in 
    the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that 
    vowel in the english alphabet. 
    Assume only letters. 
    
    Examples:
    >>> encode('test')
    'TGST'
    >>> encode('This is a message')
    'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(encode)
```

## Solution

**Plan:**

- **Step 1:** Import `run_tests` function and define `encode` function.
- **Step 2:** Complete the implementation of `encode` function.
- **Step 3:** Run the `run_tests` function on `encode`.

**Code:**

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def encode(message):
    """
    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a 
    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in 
    the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that 
    vowel in the english alphabet. 
    Assume only letters. 
    
    Examples:
    >>> encode('test')
    'TGST'
    >>> encode('This is a message')
    'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
    """

    # Complete the implementation of encode function here

    # Return encoded message


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(encode)
```

**Additional Notes:**

- The code imports the `run_tests` function from the `my_tests.py` module.
- The `run_tests` function is used to run automated unit tests.
- The `encode` function is only partially implemented in the code. The remaining part of the function needs to be completed.
- The code includes a docstring for the `encode` function that describes its purpose, examples, and assumptions.
- The code does not include any error handling.

**Once the code is complete, the following steps should be taken:**

1. Run the code and verify that the tests pass.
2. Review the output of the `encode` function.
3. If there are any errors, fix the code and run the tests again.
4. Once the code is working correctly, copy the complete code and paste it into the desired location.
