Import Libraries:**\n\n- The code imports the `run_tests` function from the `my_tests` module.\n\n**2. Define the `pairs_sum_to_zero` Function:**\n\n- The function takes a list of integers `l` as input.\n- The function returns `True` if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `False` otherwise.\n- The function is partially implemented, and the remaining part needs to be completed.\n\n**3. Run the Unit Tests:**\n\n- The `run_tests` function is called with the `pairs_sum_to_zero` function as an argument.\n- The output of the unit tests is printed to the console.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The code includes a docstring for the `pairs_sum_to_zero` function that describes its purpose, parameters, and return value.\n- The code includes a `print` statement at the end to display the output of the test results.\n- The code includes a `try-except` block to catch the `NameError` that occurs when the `run_tests` function is called with an undefined function as an argument.\n\n**Overall, this code provides a well-structured solution for completing a task that requires implementing a function and running unit tests. It includes important elements such as docstrings, proper error handling, and clear output display.**",
