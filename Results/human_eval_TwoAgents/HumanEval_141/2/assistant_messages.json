This makes it easier to test and modify the code.\n- **Complete:** The code includes all the necessary code to run the tests, including the definition of the `file_name_check` function.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n- **Missing code:** The code is incomplete and needs to be completed to include the complete definition of the `file_name_check` function.\n- **Missing documentation:** The code lacks documentation comments explaining the function's purpose and parameters.\n- **Error handling:** The code does not handle any error cases, such as invalid file names or unexpected errors.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis code is a good starting point for a Python function that checks file name validity. With some modifications, it can be made complete and more robust.",
