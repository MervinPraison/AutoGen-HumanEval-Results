Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- **Clear plan:** The code clearly defines the steps involved in completing the task, including importing necessary libraries, defining the function, and running the tests.\n- **Modular:** The code separates the function definition from the test execution, making it easier to modify and test the function independently.\n- **Documentation:** The code includes docstrings for the function, explaining its purpose and usage.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n- **Missing implementation:** The code lacks the actual implementation of the `greatest_common_divisor` function.\n- **Missing test cases:** The code only includes a few basic test cases. More test cases should be added to cover various scenarios.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis code provides a good starting point for completing the task. With the missing implementation completed, the code should be able to pass all the tests.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The code assumes that the `run_tests` function is defined in the `my_tests.py` file.\n- The code outputs the results of the tests, including any errors encountered.\n- The code does not include any error handling for the `greatest_common_divisor` function.\n- The code does not include any documentation for the `greatest_common_divisor` function.",
