Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n**Imports:**\n\n- `run_tests` function from `my_tests.py` is imported to run the unit tests.\n\n**Function Definition:**\n\n- `words_in_sentence` function is defined with one parameter, `sentence`, which takes a string as input.\n- The function aims to extract words from a sentence whose length is prime.\n\n**Missing Implementation:**\n\n- The code lacks the actual implementation of the `words_in_sentence` function. This part needs to be completed by the user.\n\n**Testing:**\n\n- The `run_tests` function is called with the `words_in_sentence` function as an argument.\n- If the tests fail, the output will display the failed tests and an error message.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The code includes a clear call to action for the user to complete the implementation and run the tests again.\n- The code does not include the output of the tests, as it is not relevant to the task of completing the code.\n- The code includes a clear exit message indicating successful execution and prompting the user to complete the implementation.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis code provides a well-structured and clear plan for completing the task. It clearly defines the steps involved and leaves the remaining implementation to the user. The code is also well-formatted and easy to read.",
