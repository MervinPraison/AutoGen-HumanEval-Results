This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the correct implementation of `words_in_sentence`.\n\nThe code also defines the `words_in_sentence` function, which takes a string `sentence` as input and returns a string containing the words from the original sentence whose lengths are prime numbers.\n\nThe code is missing the actual implementation of the `words_in_sentence` function. The code above is an example of how to complete the function. You need to fill in the missing code between the `# Complete this function` comment and the `return` statement.\n\nOnce you have completed the code, you can run the tests by executing the code below:\n\n```\npython\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n# Replace this line with your completed code\nwords_in_sentence(\"This is a test\")\n\nrun_tests(words_in_sentence)\n```\n\nIf the tests pass, you will see the output:\n\n```\nPASSED\n```\n\nIf the tests fail, you will see the output of the tests and the specific errors that occurred. You can then fix the code and run the tests again until they pass.",
