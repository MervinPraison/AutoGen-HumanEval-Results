The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `all_prefixes`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `all_prefixes`. However, `all_prefixes` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `all_prefixes` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(all_prefixes)`, as well as all_prefixes's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests

from typing import List


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(all_prefixes)
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To complete the implementation of `all_prefixes`, you can use a nested loop to iterate over the characters in the input string, and return a list of all prefixes. Here's the completed code:
```python
from typing import List

def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    prefixes = []
    for i in range(len(string)):
        prefix = ""
        for j in range(i+1):
            prefix += string[j]
            prefixes.append(prefix)
    return prefixes
```
This code defines a function `all_prefixes` that takes a string as input and returns a list of all its prefixes. The function uses a nested loop to iterate over the characters in the input string, and appends each prefix to the list `prefixes`.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input string is non-empty. If the input string is empty, the function should return an empty list. You can add this check by modifying the line `for i in range(len(string)):` to `if len(string) > 0: for i in range(len(string)):`.
