It returns 2^`n` modulo `p`, using the `%` operator to perform the modular exponentiation.\n\nTo test this function, we can run the following code:\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef modp(n: int, p: int):\n    \"\"\"Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).\"\"\"\n    return 2**n % p\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(modp)\n```\nThis will run the unit tests for the function `modp`, which checks that it produces the correct results when applied to several test cases. If the test passes, the code will print \"OK\", otherwise it will print an error message indicating where the problem occurred.",
