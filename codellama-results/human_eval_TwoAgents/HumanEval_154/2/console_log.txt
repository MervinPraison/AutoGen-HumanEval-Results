user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `cycpattern_check`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `cycpattern_check`. However, `cycpattern_check` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `cycpattern_check` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(cycpattern_check)`, as well as cycpattern_check's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def cycpattern_check(a , b):
    """You are given 2 words. You need to return True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word
    cycpattern_check("abcd","abd") => False
    cycpattern_check("hello","ell") => True
    cycpattern_check("whassup","psus") => False
    cycpattern_check("abab","baa") => True
    cycpattern_check("efef","eeff") => False
    cycpattern_check("himenss","simen") => True

    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(cycpattern_check)
