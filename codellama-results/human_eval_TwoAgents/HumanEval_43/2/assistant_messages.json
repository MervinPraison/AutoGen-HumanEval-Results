Create a new function that takes two integers as arguments, and returns True if they sum to zero, and False otherwise. This function should be named `is_sum_to_zero`.\n2. Modify the original implementation of `pairs_sum_to_zero` to call the `is_sum_to_zero` function with every pair of integers in the input list. If any two pairs sum to zero, return True immediately. Otherwise, return False.\n3. Test your modified implementation by running the unit tests provided in the code block.\n\nHere's a code block that contains everything needed to run the tests and complete the implementation of `pairs_sum_to_zero`:\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef is_sum_to_zero(a, b):\n    return a + b == 0\n\ndef pairs_sum_to_zero(l):\n    for i in range(len(l)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(l)):\n            if is_sum_to_zero(l[i], l[j]):\n                return True\n    return False\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(pairs_sum_to_zero)\n```\nThis code block imports the `my_tests` module, which contains the `run_tests` function that runs the automated unit tests. It then defines two new functions: `is_sum_to_zero`, which takes two integers as arguments and returns True if they sum to zero, and False otherwise. The second function, `pairs_sum_to_zero`, takes a list of integers as an input and returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.\n\nTo test your implementation of `pairs_sum_to_zero`, you can run the unit tests provided in the code block. This will automatically call the `run_tests` function with your implementation of `pairs_sum_to_zero` as an argument, and compare its output to the expected output based on the unit tests. If your implementation is correct, the test should pass successfully.\n\nOnce you have completed the implementation and tested it, you can save this code block in a file (e.g., `solution.py`) and run it directly in Python using `python solution.py`. This will execute the automated unit tests and check whether your implementation is correct or not.",
