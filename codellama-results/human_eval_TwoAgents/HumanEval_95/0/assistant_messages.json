The `run_tests` function from the `my_tests` module is being executed on the `check_dict_case` function, which includes several examples of inputs and expected outputs. These tests are used to verify that the implementation of the `check_dict_case` function is correct and returns the correct output for different inputs.\n\nIn this case, the code is correctly returning `True` for the first three test cases and `False` for the fourth and fifth test cases.
