The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `sort_array`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `sort_array`. However, `sort_array` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `sort_array` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(sort_array)`, as well as sort_array's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def sort_array(array):
    """
    Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting,
    you will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd,
    or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.

    Note:
    * don't change the given array.

    Examples:
    * sort_array([]) => []
    * sort_array([5]) => [5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]) => [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
    """



# Run the unit tests

```

assistant (to user_proxy):


The provided code imports the `run_tests` function from my_tests.py and runs it on the `sort_array` function. However, the `sort_array` function is only partially implemented in the code block, as it only contains the definition of the function without its actual implementation. To complete the implementation of `sort_array`, we need to add the missing code that actually sorts the given array.

Here's a corrected version of the code with the full implementation of the `sort_array` function:
```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def sort_array(array):
    """
    Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting,
    you will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd,
    or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.

    Note:
    * don't change the given array.

    Examples:
    * sort_array([]) => []
    * sort_array([5]) => [5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]) => [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
    """
    sorted_array = array[:]
    if sum(sorted_array[0], sorted_array[-1]) % 2 == 0:
        sorted_array.sort()
    else:
        sorted_array.reverse()
    return sorted_array

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(sort_array)
```
This code defines the `sort_array` function that takes an array of non-negative integers as input and returns a copy of the given array after sorting it in ascending order if the sum of its first and last elements is even, or in descending order if the sum is odd. The function first creates a copy of the given array using the slice notation `array[:]`. Then, it checks whether the sum of the first and last elements of the sorted array is even or not by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the sum is even, the function sorts the sorted array in ascending order using the `sort()` method. Otherwise, it sorts the sorted array in descending order using the `reverse()` method. Finally, the function returns the sorted array.

The code block then runs the unit tests on the `sort_array` function by calling the `run_tests` function with the `sort_array` function as an argument.
