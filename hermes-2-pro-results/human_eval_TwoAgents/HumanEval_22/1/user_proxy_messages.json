Any non-integer values that are encountered during this process will simply be ignored via the 'pass' statement in the except block.\n\nThe user can save the code above into a file named `filter_integers_test.py` and run it using the Python interpreter, expecting the output to be a successful passing of all tests defined within `my_tests.py`. \n\nTERMINATE",
