We can use the built-in `substring` checking method, but since we are dealing with potentially rotated strings, we'll need to iterate through all possible rotations of the second string and check if any match as a substring in the first string. Here's the complete implementation:\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef cycpattern_check(a, b):\n    \"\"\"You are given 2 words.

Users can save the code into a file with a .py extension, such as 'cycpattern.py', and execute it in Python. The output will show whether the tests pass or fail. \nTERMINATE",
