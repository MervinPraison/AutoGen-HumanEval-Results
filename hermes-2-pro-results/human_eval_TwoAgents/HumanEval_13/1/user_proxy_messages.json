Let's start over, and this time I will ensure that the `greatest_common_divisor` function is correctly implemented before running the tests.\n\nHere's the correct implementation of the `greatest_common_divisor` function:\n\n```python\ndef greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)\n    1\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)\n    5\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n```\n\nNow I will include the test-running code. As before, you will need a file named `my_tests.py` in the same directory that contains a function called `run_tests()`. Also, please ensure that the `my_tests.py` file correctly defines the `run_tests(candidate)` function, which takes a function as an argument and runs a set of automated unit tests on it.\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary test-running code from my_tests\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n# Define the greatest_common_divisor function\ndef greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\n# Run the unit tests for greatest_common_divisor\nrun_tests(greatest_common_divisor)\n```\n\nNow you can run this code block. You should now see the correct output from the tests, indicating that the `greatest_common_divisor` function is working as intended.\n\nTERMINATE",
