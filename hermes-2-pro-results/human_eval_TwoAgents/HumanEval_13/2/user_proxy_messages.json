The Euclidean algorithm repeatedly subtracts the smaller number from the larger one, until both numbers are equal. At that point, this equal value is the greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\nHere's a Python implementation of `greatest_common_divisor` using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)\n    1\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)\n    5\n    \"\"\"\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\n# Now we can run the unit tests\nrun_tests(greatest_common_divisor)\n```\n\nThis code is ready to be run directly in Python. When you execute this code, it first imports `run_tests` from `my_tests.py`, then defines `greatest_common_divisor`, and finally runs the unit tests using `run_tests(greatest_common_divisor)`. The Euclidean algorithm ensures that `greatest_common_divisor` now functions correctly.\n\nTo run the code, save it in a file with any name (e.g., `my_code.py`) and execute it using Python:\n```sh\n# filename: my_code.py\npython my_code.py\n```",
