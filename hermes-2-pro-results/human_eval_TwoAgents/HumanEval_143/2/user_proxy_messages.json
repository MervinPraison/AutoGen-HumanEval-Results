We can define a helper function `is_prime` to check for prime numbers, and use this function in our main function `words_in_sentence`. Here's the full code needed to run the tests:\n```python\n# filename: run_tests_words_in_sentence.py\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    words = sentence.split()\n    prime_words = []\n    for word in words:\n        if is_prime(len(word)):\n            prime_words.append(word)\n    return ' '.join(prime_words)\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(words_in_sentence)\n```\nThis code should be saved in a file named `run_tests_words_in_sentence.py`, and can be executed directly in Python. The implementation of `words_in_sentence` checks each word's length against the helper function `is_prime`, including splitting the sentence into words, storing prime-length words in a separate list, and then joining the prime-length words back into a string with spaces between them. This should pass all the tests designed in `my_tests.py`.",
