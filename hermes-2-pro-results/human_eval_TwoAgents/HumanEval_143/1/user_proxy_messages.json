We can use a helper function to check for prime numbers:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Return True if n is a prime number, else False\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    elif n == 2:\n        return True\n    elif n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nNow we can use this helper function to filter out words with lengths that are prime numbers:\n\n```python\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    words = sentence.split()\n    prime_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]\n    return ' '.join(prime_words)\n```\n\nNow we have a complete `words_in_sentence` function, and we can run the tests:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Return True if n is a prime number, else False\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    elif n == 2:\n        return True\n    elif n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    words = sentence.split()\n    prime_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]\n    return ' '.join(prime_words)\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(words_in_sentence)\n```\n\nNow you can run this code to execute the tests and verify the implementation of `words_in_sentence`.\nTERMINATE",
