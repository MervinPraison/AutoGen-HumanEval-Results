Here's the full code including the function definition and running the tests:\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef is_palindrome(num):\n    return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]\n\n\ndef even_odd_palindrome(n):\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            if is_palindrome(i):\n                even_count += 1\n        else:\n            if is_palindrome(i):\n                odd_count += 1\n    return (even_count, odd_count)\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(even_odd_palindrome)\n```\nThis code defines the helper function `is_palindrome` to check if a number is a palindrome. Then it iterates through the range (1, n + 1) and checks each number for being even or odd and whether it's a palindrome. The counts of even and odd palindromes are updated accordingly.\nFinally, it returns a tuple containing the count of even palindromes followed by the count of odd palindromes. By running `run_tests(even_odd_palindrome)`, we can verify if our implementation correctly handles the examples given in the problem statement and meets the given conditions.",
