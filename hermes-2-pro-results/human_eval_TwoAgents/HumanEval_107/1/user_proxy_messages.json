The error message suggests trying again, but since we want to ensure successful execution, let's verify and correct the implementation of the `even_odd_palindrome` function first.\n\nUpon reviewing the code, I noticed that we need to consider cases where a palindrome number starts with '1'. For example, in Example 1, the number 2 is an even palindrome while the number 1 is an odd palindrome (although it's not included in the output). So let's adjust the function accordingly:\n\n```python\ndef even_odd_palindrome(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd\n    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.\n\n    Example 1:\n\n        Input: 3\n        Output: (1, 2)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even (starts with '2'), and two of them are odd (starts with '1').\n\n    Example 2:\n\n        Input: 12\n        Output: (4, 6)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even (starts with '2' or '4' or '6' or '8'), and 6 of them are odd (starts with '1' or '3' or '5' or '7' or '9' or '11').\n\n    Note:\n        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3\n        2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    palindrome_counts = [0, 0]\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        number = str(i)\n        if number == number[::-1]:\n            if i % 2 == 0 and number[0] != '1':\n                palindrome_counts[0] += 1\n            elif i % 2 != 0:\n                palindrome_counts[1] += 1\n            else:\n                palindrome_counts[0] += 1  # cases where number starts with '1' (e.g., 101)\n\n    return palindrome_counts\n```\n\nNow we will run the unit tests again using the updated `even_odd_palindrome` function.
