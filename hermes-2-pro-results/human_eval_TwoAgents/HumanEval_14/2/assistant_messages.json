We will use the concept of range in Python along with list comprehension to generate prefixes from shortest to longest. Here is the complete definition for `all_prefixes`:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:\n    prefixes = [i for i in range(len(string)+1)]\n    return [string[:i] for i in prefixes]\n```\nIn the above code, we first create a list called `prefixes` that includes numbers ranging from 0 to the length of the input string plus one. Then, using list comprehension, we generate a new list of strings where each string is a prefix of the input string corresponding to the index in our `prefixes` list.\n\nTo run the unit tests for `all_prefixes`, add the following code:\n\n```python\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(all_prefixes)\n```\n\nNow, you can copy and paste the complete code below into a file named `complete_all_prefixes.py` and execute it in Python to run the tests:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:\n    prefixes = [i for i in range(len(string)+1)]\n    return [string[:i] for i in prefixes]\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(all_prefixes)\n```",

We can use the `assert` statement to compare the actual output of `all_prefixes` with the expected output for several test cases:\n\n```python\ndef test_all_prefixes():\n    assert all_prefixes('') == []\n    assert all_prefixes('a') == ['']\n    assert all_prefixes('abc') == ['', 'a', 'ab', 'abc']\n```\n\nNow, we need to define the `all_prefixes` function.
