SCENARIO.PY STARTING !#!#
user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `file_name_check`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `file_name_check`. However, `file_name_check` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `file_name_check` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(file_name_check)`, as well as file_name_check's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(file_name_check)
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

To complete the implementation of `file_name_check`, we need to add the validation rules mentioned in the function's docstring. Here is the completed function:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)
    """
    if len([num for num in file_name if num.isdigit()]) > 3:
        return 'No'

    if file_name.count('.') != 1:
        return 'No'

    if not file_name[0].isalpha():
        return 'No'

    allowed_extensions = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']

    after_dot = file_name.split('.')[1]

    if after_dot not in allowed_extensions:
        return 'No'

    return 'Yes'
```

Now, we can run the tests by combining the necessary code blocks as follows:

```python
# Import the required function from my_tests.py to run the tests
from my_tests import run_tests

# Define the file_name_check function with its complete implementation
def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)
    """
    if len([num for num in file_name if num.isdigit()]) > 3:
        return 'No'

    if file_name.count('.') != 1:
        return 'No'

    if not file_name[0].isalpha():
        return 'No'

    allowed_extensions = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']

    after_dot = file_name.split('.')[1]

    if after_dot not in allowed_extensions:
        return 'No'

    return 'Yes'

# Run the unit tests for file_name_check function
run_tests(file_name_check)
```

Now, the user can save this code to a file with `.py` extension (e.g., `script.py`) and run it using Python. The tests will be executed, and the output should indicate that all tests passed.
