Then it checks whether the substring after the dot is one of the valid extensions (['txt', 'exe', 'dll']). If all conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes', otherwise it returns 'No'.\n\nNow we can run the unit tests by importing `my_tests` and calling the `run_tests` function on `file_name_check`.
