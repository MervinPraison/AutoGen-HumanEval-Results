SCENARIO.PY STARTING !#!#
user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `file_name_check`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `file_name_check`. However, `file_name_check` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `file_name_check` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(file_name_check)`, as well as file_name_check's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(file_name_check)
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

To complete the implementation of `file_name_check`, we need to define its full functionality according to the given conditions. Here is the completed function:

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)
    """
    has_digits = sum(c.isdigit() for c in file_name) > 3
    has_dot = '.' in file_name
    has_alphabet_start = re.match('[aA-zZ][aA-zZ]*', file_name[0:file_name.find('.')]) is not None
    has_valid_extension = file_name[file_name.find('.'):] in ['.txt', '.exe', '.dll']
    
    if not has_digits and has_dot and has_alphabet_start and has_valid_extension:
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'
```

The function uses regular expression matching to check whether the substring before the dot starts with a latin alphabetic letter. Then it checks whether the substring after the dot is one of the valid extensions (['txt', 'exe', 'dll']). If all conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes', otherwise it returns 'No'.

Now we can run the unit tests by importing `my_tests` and calling the `run_tests` function on `file_name_check`. Here is the complete code block that contains everything needed to run the tests:

```python
# filename: unit_test.py
from my_tests import run_tests

import re


def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)
    """
    has_digits = sum(c.isdigit() for c in file_name) > 3
    has_dot = '.' in file_name
    has_alphabet_start = re.match('[aA-zZ][aA-zZ]*', file_name[0:file_name.find('.')]) is not None
    has_valid_extension = file_name[file_name.find('.'):] in ['.txt', '.exe', '.dll']
    
    if not has_digits and has_dot and has_alphabet_start and has_valid_extension:
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'


run_tests(file_name_check)
```
