            "content": "To complete the `right_angle_triangle` function and run the provided tests, we need to use the law of cosines to determine if a triangle is right-angled. The law of cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, the following equation holds:\n\nc\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere C is the angle opposite side c. For a right-angled triangle, C is 90 degrees, so cos(C) equals 0. Therefore, we can check if a triangle is right-angled by verifying if the law of cosines' equation simplifies to a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 >= c\u00b2.\n\nHere's the complete code that you can run directly in Python:\n\n```python\n# filename: right_angle_triangle_tests.py\n\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n    '''\n    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
