This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the\ncorrect implementation of `right_angle_triangle`. However, `right_angle_triangle` is only partially\nimplemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `right_angle_triangle` and output\na new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing\n`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(right_angle_triangle)`, as well as right_angle_triangle's complete definition,\nsuch that this code block can be run directly in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n    '''\n    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three\n    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.\n    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or \n    90 degree.\n    Example:\n    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True\n    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False\n    '''\n\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(right_angle_triangle)\n```\n",

            "content": "To complete the implementation of `right_angle_triangle`, we can use the Pythagorean theorem which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In other words, if a, b and c are the lengths of the three sides of the triangle, then we can determine if it's a right-angle triangle by checking if c^2 = a^2 + b^2.\n\nHere's the complete Python code needed to run the tests:\n\n```python\n# filename: right_angle_triangle_tests.py\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n    '''\n    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three\n    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.\n    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or \n    90 degree.\n    Example:\n    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True\n    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False\n    '''\n    return c**2 == a**2 + b**2\n\nrun_tests(right_angle_triangle)\n```\n\nNow you can save this code in a file named `right_angle_triangle_tests.py`. The user can execute the tests by running the Python file using the command:\n\n```sh\npython right_angle_triangle_tests.py\n```\n\nTERMINATE",
