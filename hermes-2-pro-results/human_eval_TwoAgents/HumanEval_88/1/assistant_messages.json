We can use Python's `sorted()` function, and then check the parity of the sum of the first and last elements to decide if we should reverse the sorted list. Here's the complete code:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef sort_array(array):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting,\n    you will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd,\n    or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.\n\n    Note:\n    * don't change the given array.\n\n    Examples:\n    * sort_array([]) => []\n    * sort_array([5]) => [5]\n    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]) => [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]\n    \"\"\"\n    sorted_arr = sorted(array)\n    is_odd = sum([sorted_arr[0], sorted_arr[-1]]) % 2 == 1\n    return sorted_arr if is_odd else sorted_arr[::-1]\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(sort_array)\n```\n\nThis code should now run the unit tests for `sort_array` correctly, according to your specified rules.

To resolve this discrepancy, please confirm the following:\n\n1. Ensure that the `test_sort_array.py` file has been saved in the same directory as the `my_tests.py` file. This is important because the `import run_tests` statement within `test_sort_array.py` requires access to the `run_tests()` function defined in `my_tests.py`.\n2. Check if there are any output lines that were unintentionally omitted during the copying of the test results. If such lines exist, they might include the actual status of the tests (passed or failed).\n3. Run the script again and provide the complete output.
