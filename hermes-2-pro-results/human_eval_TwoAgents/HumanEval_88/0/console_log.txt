user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `sort_array`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `sort_array`. However, `sort_array` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `sort_array` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(sort_array)`, as well as sort_array's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def sort_array(array):
    """
    Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting,
    you will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd,
    or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.

    Note:
    * don't change the given array.

    Examples:
    * sort_array([]) => []
    * sort_array([5]) => [5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]) => [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(sort_array)
```

assistant (to user_proxy):

To complete the `sort_array` function and run the unit tests, follow these steps:

Step 1: Import the required module.
```python
from my_tests import run_tests
```

Step 2: Define the `sort_array` function with a complete implementation that sorts the given array as specified in the task. Here's the completed function:
```python
def sort_array(array):
    sum_first_last = sum(array[0], array[-1])
    
    if sum_first_last % 2 == 0:
        array_sorted = sorted(array, reverse=True)
    else:
        array_sorted = sorted(array)
        
    return array_sorted
```

Step 3: Run the unit tests using the `run_tests` function and passing `sort_array` as an argument. This will verify that the `sort_array` function is correctly implemented.

Here's the stand-alone code block that combines all three steps:
```python
from my_tests import run_tests

def sort_array(array):
    sum_first_last = sum(array[0], array[-1])
    
    if sum_first_last % 2 == 0:
        array_sorted = sorted(array, reverse=True)
    else:
        array_sorted = sorted(array)
        
    return array_sorted

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(sort_array)
```
