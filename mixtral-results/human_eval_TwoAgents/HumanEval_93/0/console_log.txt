user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `encode`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `encode`. However, `encode` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `encode` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(encode)`, as well as encode's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def encode(message):
    """
    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a 
    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in 
    the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that 
    vowel in the english alphabet. 
    Assume only letters. 
    
    Examples:
    >>> encode('test')
    'TGST'
    >>> encode('This is a message')
    'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(encode)
```

assistant (to user_proxy):

Here's the completed `encode` function and the code to run the tests. The `encode` function swaps case of all letters and replaces all vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that vowel in the English alphabet.

```python
# filename: run_encode_tests.py

import string

from my_tests import run_tests


def encode(message):
    """
    Encodes a message by swapping case of all letters, and replacing all vowels
    in the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that vowel in the
    English alphabet.
    
    Examples:
    >>> encode('test')
    'TGST'
    >>> encode('This is a message')
    'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
    """
    trans_table = str.maketrans(
        string.ascii_lowercase + string.ascii_uppercase,
        string.ascii_uppercase + string.ascii_lowercase,
        'aeiou'
    )
    vowels = set('aeiou')
    encoded = []

    for char in message.translate(trans_table):
        if char in vowels:
            index = ('aeiou'.index(char.lower()) + 2) % 5
            encoded.append(('aeiou'[index]).upper() if char.isupper() else 'aeiou'[index])
        else:
            encoded.append(char.lower() if char.isupper() else char.upper())

    return ''.join(encoded)


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(encode)
```

This code imports the `run_tests` function from `my_tests.py`, defines the `encode` function, and then runs the tests using `run_tests(encode)`. The `encode` function is now fully implemented.

To run the code, save it in a file named `run_encode_tests.py` and execute it using Python:

```sh
python run_encode_tests.py
```

After running the code, the output should show that the tests have passed. If there are any errors, please let me know, and I will fix them.
