SCENARIO.PY STARTING !#!#
user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `cycpattern_check`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `cycpattern_check`. However, `cycpattern_check` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `cycpattern_check` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(cycpattern_check)`, as well as cycpattern_check's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def cycpattern_check(a , b):
    """You are given 2 words. You need to return True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word
    cycpattern_check("abcd","abd") => False
    cycpattern_check("hello","ell") => True
    cycpattern_check("whassup","psus") => False
    cycpattern_check("abab","baa") => True
    cycpattern_check("efef","eeff") => False
    cycpattern_check("himenss","simen") => True

    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(cycpattern_check)
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

Here's the complete code that includes the implementation of `cycpattern_check` and the code to run the tests:

```python
# filename: cycpattern_check_tests.py

from my_tests import run_tests


def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    """You are given 2 words. You need to return True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word
    cycpattern_check("abcd","abd") => False
    cycpattern_check("hello","ell") => True
    cycpattern_check("whassup","psus") => False
    cycpattern_check("abab","baa") => True
    cycpattern_check("efef","eeff") => False
    cycpattern_check("himenss","simen") => True
    """
    for i in range(len(b)):
        if b[i:] + b[:i] in a:
            return True
    return False


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(cycpattern_check)
```

You can save the above code in a file named `cycpattern_check_tests.py` and run it using Python.

The `cycpattern_check` function checks if any rotation of the second word `b` is a substring of the first word `a`. It does this by iterating over the length of `b` and concatenating the end of `b` with the beginning of `b` (forming a rotation) and checking if it's a substring of `a`.

The `run_tests` function from `my_tests` is called with `cycpattern_check` as the argument, which will run the automated unit tests to verify the correct implementation of `cycpattern_check`.
