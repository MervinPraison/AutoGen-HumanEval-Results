Based on the output, it seems that at least one of the tests defined in the `my_tests` module is not passing when run with the `file_name_check` function.\n\nGiven the provided code, I would suggest reviewing the implementation of the `file_name_check` function and ensuring that it meets the requirements outlined in the comments. Specifically, you should check the following:\n\n1. Check that the function handles file names with more than three digits correctly.\n2. Check that the function handles file names with no dot or multiple dots correctly.\n3. Check that the function handles file names with non-alphabetic characters before the dot correctly.\n4. Check that the function handles file names with invalid extensions correctly.\n\nAfter reviewing the implementation, you can make any necessary changes and re-run the tests using the provided code. If you still encounter issues, you can try adding additional tests to the `my_tests` module to further diagnose the problem.\n\nBased on the output, it seems that the issue is with the `file_name_check` function implementation. I would recommend revisiting the implementation and checking for any potential issues. If you need further assistance, please provide more information about the specific tests that are failing and any error messages that are being displayed.",
