It then sorts the dictionary by strength (with the strongest first) and then by the index of the extension in the original list. Finally, it returns the first extension in the sorted list, which is the strongest extension.\n\nThe `run_tests(Strongest_Extension)` line runs the unit tests on the `Strongest_Extension` function.\n\nPlease note that I cannot test this code as I don't have the `my_tests.py` file and the implementation of the `run_tests` function. However, I'm confident that this implementation of `Strongest_Extension` is correct based on the given specification.",
