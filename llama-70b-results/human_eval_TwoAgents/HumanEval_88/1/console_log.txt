user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `sort_array`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `sort_array`. However, `sort_array` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `sort_array` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(sort_array)`, as well as sort_array's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def sort_array(array):
    """
    Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting,
    you will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd,
    or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.

    Note:
    * don't change the given array.

    Examples:
    * sort_array([]) => []
    * sort_array([5]) => [5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]) => [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

Here's a brief explanation of the completed `sort_array` function:

The function takes an array of non-negative integers as input, and returns a copy of the array after sorting it. The sorting order is determined by the sum of the first and last index values. If the sum is odd, the array is sorted in ascending order, otherwise, it's sorted in descending order.

The function uses the built-in `sorted` function to perform the actual sorting. If the sum of the first and last index values is odd, the `reverse` argument is set to `True` to sort the array in descending order. Otherwise, the array is sorted in ascending order by default.

The `run_tests` function is then called with the `sort_array` function as its argument, to run the unit tests.

You can copy and paste this code block directly into a Python interpreter or save it to a file with a `.py` extension, and run it from the command line using `python sort_array.py`.

The function takes an array of non-negative integers as input, and returns a copy of the array after sorting it. The sorting order is determined by the sum of the first and last index values. If the sum is odd, the array is sorted in ascending order, otherwise, it's sorted in descending order.
The function uses the built-in `sorted` function to perform the actual sorting. If the sum of the first and last index values is odd, the `reverse` argument is set to `True` to sort the array in descending order. Otherwise, the array is sorted in ascending order by default.
The `run_tests` function is then called with the `sort_array` function as its argument, to run the unit tests.

You can copy and paste this code block directly into a Python interpreter or save it to a file with a `.py` extension, and run it from the command line using `python sort_array.py`.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.

    Note:
    * don't change the given array.

    Examples:
    * sort_array([]) => []
