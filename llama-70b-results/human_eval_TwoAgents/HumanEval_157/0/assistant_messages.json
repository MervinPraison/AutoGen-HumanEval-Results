Here's a possible completion of the code:\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n    '''\n    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three\n    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.\n    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or \n    90 degree.\n    Example:\n    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True\n    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False\n    '''\n    # Use the Pythagorean theorem to determine if the triangle is a right triangle\n    if a**2 + b**2 == c**2:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(right_angle_triangle)\n```\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening in the completed code:\n\n1. The `right_angle_triangle` function is defined. It takes three arguments, `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.\n2. The function uses the Pythagorean theorem to determine if the triangle is a right triangle. It checks if the square of the lengths of the two shorter sides is equal to the square of the length of the third side. If it is, then the triangle is a right triangle, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n3. The `run_tests` function from `my_tests` is called with `right_angle_triangle` as its argument. This runs a set of automated unit tests to verify the correct implementation of `right_angle_triangle`.\n\nTo run the code, save it in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g. `right_angle_triangle.py`) and run it from the command line using `python right_angle_triangle.py`. This will run the unit tests and output the result.\n\nTERMINATE",
