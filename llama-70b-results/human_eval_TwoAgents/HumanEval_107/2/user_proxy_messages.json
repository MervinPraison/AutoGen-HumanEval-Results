Here's a possible implementation of `even_odd_palindrome` that completes the given code block:\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef even_odd_palindrome(n):\n    even_palindromes = 0\n    odd_palindromes = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                even_palindromes += 1\n            else:\n                odd_palindromes += 1\n    return (even_palindromes, odd_palindromes)\n\n\nrun_tests(even_odd_palindrome)\n```\nThis code defines a function `even_odd_palindrome` that takes an integer `n` as input, and returns a tuple containing the number of even and odd integer palindromes within the range `[1, n]`.\n\nThe function uses a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to `n`, and checks each number to see if it is a palindrome. If it is, the function increments the appropriate counter (either `even_palindromes` or `odd_palindromes`) depending on whether the number is even or odd.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple containing the values of `even_palindromes` and `odd_palindromes`.\n\nWith this implementation, the code block should now work as intended and pass the unit tests.",
