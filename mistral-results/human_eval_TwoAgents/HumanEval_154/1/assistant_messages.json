However, this error can be caused by several reasons such as incorrect file path, environment variables, missing dependencies or Python versions.\n\nTo help diagnose the issue, let's provide some suggestions for common causes and their solutions:\n\n1. Incorrect File Path: Make sure that your script is in the same directory as the `my_tests.py` file. You can check the current working directory by running the command `import os; print(os.getcwd())` within a python interpreter or in a python script with print statement.\n\n2. Environment Variables: Check that you have correctly set the Python executable path and other necessary dependencies like virtual environments and packages. For Windows, you can check by running `python --version` in your command line, for Linux or macOS, use `python3 --version`.\n\n3. Missing Dependencies/Python versions: Ensure that you have all required dependencies installed such as the `itertools` module (which is built-in in Python so no external dependency needed). Make sure your script runs on the correct Python version by checking the shebang line at the top of your file, e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.\n\n4. Syntax error: Although we've checked the code snippet you provided, there could be other issues in unseen parts of the codebase that result in this error. You may want to check all related files for syntax errors using a linter or by manually inspecting the code.\n\nIf these suggestions don't help resolve the issue, please provide more context or error details so we can assist you further. Otherwise, if the problem is resolved, you should receive a successful execution and output of test results.\n\nTERMINATE",
