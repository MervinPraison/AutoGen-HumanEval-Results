In this scenario, it is assumed that you want to check if a given input string `a` consists of distinct words where the last word is the reversed version of the first word. The `cycpattern_check(a)` function in the provided code block handles this logic for you.\n\nTo test the functionality, feel free to call the function with various string inputs:\n\n```python\n# Test cases\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"hello world\"))          # False\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"apple tomato\"))          # True\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"cat dog cat\"))          # True\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"one two three one\"))      # True\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"the quick brown fox\"))   # False\n```\n\nLet me know if you have any other tasks or requirements. If this task has been completed, I will terminate the conversation.\n\nTERMINATE",
