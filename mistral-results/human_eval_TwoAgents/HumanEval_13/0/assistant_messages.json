            "content": " To complete the `greatest_common_divisor` function and run the tests, follow these steps:\n\n1. Use your language skill to understand that the `greatest_common_divisor` function as written only imports the `run_tests` function but does not implement the function itself. To implement it, we need to use the Euclidean algorithm, which consists of repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the greater number and then swapping the numbers until they are equal.\n\n2. Use your language skill to write the `greatest_common_divisor` function with this logic:\n\n```python\ndef greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    while a != b:\n        if a > b:\n            a, b = b, a\n        a -= b\n    return abs(a)\n```\n\n3. Now, the `greatest_common_divisor` function is complete and ready to be run with the tests. Update the code block to include the import statement for `my_tests`, call `run_tests(greatest_common_divisor)`, and add a comment explaining what the code does:\n\n```python\n# filename: main.py\n\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b\n        using the Euclidean algorithm\n        >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)\n            1\n        >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)\n            5\n    \"\"\"\n    while a != b:\n        if a > b:\n            a, b = b, a\n        a -= b\n    return abs(a)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    run_tests(greatest_common_divisor)\n```\n\n4. Verify the code works by executing it and checking that it passes all tests. The user should see the test results printed in the console without any errors. If there are errors, analyze them and suggest necessary corrections. If everything is okay, output \"TERMINATE\".",
