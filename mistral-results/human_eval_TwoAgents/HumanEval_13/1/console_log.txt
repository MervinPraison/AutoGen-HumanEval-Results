SCENARIO.PY STARTING !#!#
user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `greatest_common_divisor`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `greatest_common_divisor`. However, `greatest_common_divisor` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `greatest_common_divisor` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(greatest_common_divisor)`, as well as greatest_common_divisor's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
    1
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
    5
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(greatest_common_divisor)
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

 To complete the implementation of `greatest_common_divisor`, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. Here's the full definition:

```python
# filename: greatest_common_divisor.py
from my_tests import run_tests

def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b using Euclidean algorithm
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
        1
        >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
        5
    """
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_tests(greatest_common_divisor)
```

This code defines `greatest_common_divisor` function using Euclidean algorithm and sets up the unit tests to be executed. To run this code, just save it in a file named 'greatest_common_divisor.py' and execute it in your Python environment. This code can be run directly without needing any other files as it imports and executes its own tests within the script itself.
