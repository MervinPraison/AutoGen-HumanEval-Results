Let's add the basic logic for checking monotonicity by comparing adjacent elements in the list. Here's a possible implementation:\n\n```python\ndef monotonic(l: list):\n    \"\"\"Return True if list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.\"\"\"\n    return all(x <= y for x, y in zip(l, l[1:])) or all(x >= y for x, y in zip(l, l[1:]))\n```\n\n2. Now that `monotonic` is implemented, you can update the code block to include importing `my_tests` and calling `run_tests(monotonic)`. Here's the updated code block:\n\n```python\n# filename: monotonic_tests.py\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef monotonic(l: list):\n    \"\"\"Return True if list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.\"\"\"\n    return all(x <= y for x, y in zip(l, l[1:])) or all(x >= y for x, y in zip(l, l[1:]))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    run_tests(monotonic)\n```\n\nTo use this code block, save it as `monotonic_tests.py`, then you can run the tests by executing this file in your Python environment. Make sure that the `my_tests.py` module is located in the same directory and contains the `run_tests` function for the tests to work correctly.",
