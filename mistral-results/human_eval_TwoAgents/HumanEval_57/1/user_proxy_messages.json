To help you identify and fix the issue, here are a few steps you can take:\n\n1. First, examine the test cases that failed to understand which test case(s) caused the problem. You might consider checking the order or types of elements in these tests to ensure they align with your expectation of the monotonic function's behavior.\n2. If you are unsure about any specific test case, try running each individual test case using the print statements to check if the expected and actual outputs match.\n3. Refactor and modify the `monotonic()` function accordingly to make sure it passes all the tests. Make sure that you have considered both cases of monotonically increasing and decreasing lists in your implementation.\n4. Once you believe you've fixed the issue, try rerunning the script again by executing the provided code block.\n5.

To help identify and fix any issues, here's some additional steps you can take:\n\n1. Double-check the test cases that failed to ensure they are valid and match your expectation for monotonic functions. Inspect the expected outputs for these test cases against the actual output from the function.\n2. Use print statements to inspect the inputs and outputs during testing. Uncomment the lines with `pdb.set_trace()` in the script, then re-run it. This will pause execution at that line, allowing you to inspect variables and their values as you step through the tests.\n3. Refactor and modify the `monotonic()` function if needed to ensure it handles both monotonically increasing and decreasing lists correctly. Ensure that your implementation checks for both conditions.\n4. Once you have made changes, re-run the script with the test cases to verify if the issues are resolved. If the tests still fail, consider providing more information about the failed tests, such as their input and expected output, as well as any relevant context from the `my_tests.py` file.\n\n```python\n# filename: monotonic_test.py\n\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\nimport pdb\n\ndef monotonic(l: list):\n    \"\"\"Return True is list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.\"\"\"\n    if len(l) < 2:\n        return True\n    else:\n        for i in range(1, len(l)):\n            if l[i - 1] > l[i]:\n                return False\n        return True\n        \n# Uncomment the following lines during testing to print test case input and output values.\n# for test in tests:\n#     print(f\"\\nTest Input: {test[0]}\")\n#     print(f\"Expected Output: {test[1]}\")\n#     pdb.set_trace()  # Uncomment this line to pause execution at each test case\n#     actual = monotonic(test[0])\n#     print(f\"Actual Output: {actual}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run_tests(monotonic)\n```[\n\nBased on the updated information, it seems that there might be an issue with test case `([1, 2, -1])`.
