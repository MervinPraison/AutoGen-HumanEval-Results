Run this command in the terminal: `$ brew install python`. Make sure to add Python to your PATH environment variable by running `echo 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/python@3.x/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile`\n3. **Install Python from the official website**: You can download the official Python installer for your operating system and install it manually: https://www.python.org/downloads/\n4. Once you have installed Python, ensure that it is added to the PATH environment variable by modifying your `~/.bash_profile` or equivalent file depending on your operating system.\n\nNow try running the script with the updated path as I mentioned in my previous response:\n\n```sh\n$ /usr/bin/python3 complete_code.py\n```\n\nThis should help you execute the Python script successfully.

            "content": " It appears that the execution has once again failed due to the \"command not found\" error. I would like to suggest another possible solution to install Python using `pyenv`. Pyenv is a python version management tool which allows you to easily switch between multiple python versions. Follow these steps to install and use pyenv:\n\n1. First, make sure you have Git installed on your system. If not, please follow the instructions here to install Git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\n2. Install pyenv by following the instructions at: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer\n3. Add pyenv to your shell configuration file, typically `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, with this line: `export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"` and add the following lines at the end of the same file: \n```bash\nif which pyenv > /dev/null; then eval \"$(pyenv init -)\" ; fi\n```\n4. Initialize your system's Python interpreter for pyenv by running `$ pyenv install --list | grep -q 'python3' && echo \"Python 3 is already installed.\" || pyenv install python3`\n5. Once you've completed the installation, you can check that Python 3 is now accessible in your terminal or CLI by running: `$ python --version`\n6. Now try executing the script using the updated path: `$ python complete_code.py`\n\nThis should help you execute the Python script successfully.
