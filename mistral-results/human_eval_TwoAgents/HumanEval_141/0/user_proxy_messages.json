Let us take a closer look at these errors to understand and resolve them.\n\nFirst, let's examine the error: \"Error in file\\_name\\_check: Invalid name before extension\". This message suggests that there is an issue with the validation of names before their extensions. To debug this issue, we can add some print statements within the function to see which test case is causing this error and understand the problem better.\n\nSecondly, the error \"Error in file\\_name\\_check: Invalid extension 'asd'\" indicates that the validation of extensions is not working properly, possibly due to an incorrect definition or usage of `valid_extensions`. To address this issue, we need to check the expected behavior of the function regarding extensions and validate if our current implementation meets those requirements.\n\nHere is a suggested solution for both issues:\n\n1. Update `file_name_check` to handle empty file names by adding a conditional statement and print a message for an empty name.\n2. Double-check that `valid_extensions` contains the expected extensions (e.g., 'txt' and 'exe'). If necessary, modify or update this list accordingly.\n3. Use debugging statements (print statements) to identify the test cases causing each issue.

If the input file names contain other characters that should be allowed as part of the filename (like underscores, numbers, or spaces), we need to update our regex accordingly.\n\nSecondly, let's tackle the issue with invalid extensions: It seems that the `valid_extensions` list currently only contains 'txt' and 'exe', but based on the test cases, there might be additional valid extensions like 'dll' or 'asd'. We need to ensure that our current implementation can handle any expected extension.\n\nHere's a suggested solution for both issues:\n\n1. Update the regular expression in `file_name_check` to allow more characters before an extension. For example, you may change it to accept alphanumeric characters and underscores (i.e., `[a-zA-Z0-9_]+\\.`).\n2. Update the `valid_extensions` list with any additional expected extensions.\n3.
