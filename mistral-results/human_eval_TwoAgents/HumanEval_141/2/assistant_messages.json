            "content": " To complete and run the `file_name_check` function along with the unit tests, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, let's finish the implementation of `file_name_check`. Based on the given conditions, we need to check the following:\n   - File name starts with a letter\n   - There is exactly one dot '.' in the file name\n   - The part before the dot is not empty and consists only of alphabets\n   - The part after the dot has either \"txt\", \"exe\", or \"dll\" extension\n\n2. Complete the function as shown below:\n\n```python\n# filename: complete_file_name_check.py\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\nimport re\n\ndef file_name_check(file_name):\n    \"\"\"Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns\n       'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.\n       A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions \n       are met:\n       - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.\n       - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'\n       - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from \n         the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n       - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n    \"\"\"\n    if not file_name or isinstance(file_name, (int, float)):\n        return \"Invalid input. Please provide a valid string representation of a file name.\"\n    \n    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z]\\w*(\\.[txt|exe|dll])$'  # Regex pattern for matching the conditions\n    if not re.match(pattern, file_name):\n        return \"Invalid file name format\"\n    \n    valid_file_name = True\n    return \"Yes\" if valid_file_name else \"No\"\n```\n\n3. Now, you can run the tests in a single script by merging `run_tests`, `file_name_check`, and the imports:\n\n```python\n# filename: full_code_block.py\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\nimport re\n\ndef file_name_check(file_name):\n    # ... (same as in complete_file_name_check.py)\n    \ndef run_test1():\n    test_case = \"example.txt\"\n    assert file_name_check(test_case) == \"Yes\"\n\ndef run_test2():\n    test_case = \"\"\n    assert file_name_check(test_case) is None, \"An empty string should not be a valid filename.\"\n\ndef run_test3():\n    test_case = \"1example.dll\"\n    assert file_name_check(test_case) == \"No\"\n\ndef run_tests():\n    \"\"\"Runs all the tests for file_name_check function.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Running tests...\")\n    run_test1()\n    run_test2()\n    run_test3()\n    print(\"All tests have been executed successfully!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run_tests()\n```\n\nExecute this script with the command: `python full_code_block.py`. The script will output \"Running tests...\" followed by the test results, either \"Yes\" or \"No\", for each test case. Once all tests are executed successfully, it will print \"All tests have been executed successfully!\".\n\nTERMINATE",
