Let's examine the `my_tests` module to better understand why the tests are failing and how we can modify the `sort_array` function to pass these tests.\n\nFirst, let's inspect the contents of `my_tests.py` to learn about the test cases:\n\n```python\n# filename: my_tests.py\nimport unittest\nfrom sorting import sort_array\n\nclass TestSortArray(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def test_empty_list(self):\n        self.assertIsNone(sort_array([]))\n        self.assertTrue(sorted([]) == [])\n\n    def test_single_element(self):\n        a = [5]\n        sorted_a = sort_array(a)\n        self.assertEqual(sorted_a, a)\n\n    def test_even_sum(self):\n        a = [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]\n        sorted_a = sort_array(a)\n        self.assertFalse(sorted_a == a)\n        self.assertTrue(sorted_a[:] == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n    def test_odd_sum(self):\n        a = [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]\n        sorted_a = sort_array(a)\n        self.assertFalse(sorted_a == a)\n        self.assertTrue(sorted_a[:] == [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nThe `my_tests.py` file contains four test cases: an empty list, a single-element array, and arrays with even or odd sums. It appears that the current implementation of `sort_array` is failing for the even and odd sum test cases. Let's inspect the logic in `sorting.py` to identify and correct any issues.\n\nThe current implementation of the `sort_array` function checks if the sum of the array elements is odd or even, but it doesn't actually sort the array based on this condition:\n\n```python\ndef sort_array(array):\n    if sum(array) % 2 == 0:\n        # This part of the code only changes a copy and does not affect the original array.\n        array_copy = array.copy()\n        array_copy.sort(reverse=True)\n        return array_copy\n    else:\n        # Similar to above but sorts in ascending order instead of descending order.\n        array_copy = array.copy()\n        array_copy.sort()\n        return array_copy\n```\n\nIt appears that the `array_copy` objects are not being reassigned back to the original arrays, causing the test cases to fail as they're checking against the original input arrays. To fix this, we should modify the logic in the `sort_array` function to sort the original array instead of creating a copy:\n\n```python\ndef sort_array(array):\n    if sum(array) % 2 == 0:\n        array.sort(reverse=True)\n    else:\n        array.sort()\n        array.reverse()\n    return array\n```\n\nNow, try running the tests again to see if they have passed. If the tests still fail, please let me know and I'll help you debug further!",
