Let's try to identify the source of the issue by examining the test cases and the actual implementation more closely. Since you didn't share the content of your `my_tests.py` file, it's hard for me to provide an accurate solution. However, I can suggest a few approaches to troubleshoot this problem:\n\n1. Examine the test cases in the `my_tests.py` file and the expected output for each test case against the actual output of our implementation. If they don't match, you might need to update the tests or modify your function accordingly.\n2. Check for potential bugs or errors in the `sort_array()` function by thoroughly reviewing its logic and ensuring it follows the given requirements. For example, make sure we're getting the sum of the first and last elements correctly and applying the correct sorting order based on that sum.\n3. Consider if there are any edge cases or specific scenarios where our function might not behave as intended and how to test for them effectively in `my_tests.py`.\n4. Try commenting out parts of the code, one line at a time, while executing the tests and observing their impact on test results. This can help narrow down the issue to a specific part of the code.\n5. If you believe that there's an issue with the way we're testing the function in `my_tests.py`, consider creating some additional test cases or modifying existing ones to cover various scenarios and edge cases effectively.\n\nKeep these troubleshooting steps in mind as you work towards identifying the problem and resolving it.
