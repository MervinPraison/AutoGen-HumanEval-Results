We iterate through every character in the message and check if it is an alphabet or not using `isalpha()`. If yes, we implement the logic to swap its case (lower to upper and vice versa) based on the current case of the character. In the case of a vowel, we find the index of the vowel in the string of all vowels using `find()` function. We then add 2 to the ASCII value of the next vowel (obtained by getting its character representation using the `chr()` function) and assign it to `next_char`. Finally, we append this character to the result string. The `run_tests(encode)` function call will verify if our implementation is correct or not.",
