Let's analyze the problem to identify the cause and propose a solution.\n\nFirst, let's check the structure of the project:\n\n1. There should be at least three files: `strong_extension.py`, `my_tests.py`, and `main.py`.\n2. The contents of each file should correspond to their respective roles as described in the given instructions.\n3. `my_tests.py` should include a function named `run_tests(candidate)` that accepts a candidate function (the Strongest Extension function).\n4. In the test cases, we should be testing the expected behavior of the Strongest Extension function with different class names and extensions lists.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible reasons for the tests failing:\n\n1. The function implementation in `strong_extension.py` might not correctly determine the strongest extension.\n2. There could be issues with test cases or their execution order in `my_tests.py`.\n3. Incorrect imports between files.\n4. Syntax errors or indentation issues in any of the code blocks.\n\nTo find and address the cause of the tests' failure, I would suggest the following steps:\n\n1. Check the test cases in `my_tests.py` to ensure they are correctly testing the Strongest Extension function as intended.\n2. Verify that the imports between files are set up correctly, checking that both `strong_extension.py` and `my_tests.py` have proper relative import paths or absolute import paths.\n3. Correct any syntax errors or indentation issues in the code blocks.\n4. If the problem persists, provide more information about the test cases and their expected behavior so that the solution can be sought with greater confidence.\n5. Double-check the function implementation in `strong_extension.py` to ensure it correctly calculates the strength of extensions based on their names.\n\nOnce you have taken these steps, retest your code to determine if the issue has been resolved. If tests continue to fail, retrace your steps and search for alternative solutions until the Strongest Extension function passes all intended test cases.",
