Inside this class, you define several test methods like `test_example1()` and `test_example2()`. These methods follow the naming convention \"test\\_<something>\" to be recognized by unittest.\n\nThe `run_tests()` function is supposed to create a unit test suite using the given function (in this case, `right_angle_triangle`) and run it using the `TextTestRunner`. It then returns the list of failed tests so that they can be printed when the script is run.\n\nThe issue in your original code seems to be in the way the tests are being added to the test suite inside the `run_tests()` function. In the current implementation, you are trying to add the entire `TestRightAngleTriangle` class to the suite by using the `makeSuite()` method instead of adding individual test methods. This is causing the unittest framework to return a list containing the entire TestCase class instead of a list of tests when it encounters a failed test case.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should modify the `run_tests()` function as follows:\n\n```python\n# filename: my_tests.py\ndef run_tests(function):\n    suite = unittest.TestSuite()\n\n    # Add each test method in the class to the test suite individually\n    for name in dir(TestRightAngleTriangle):\n        if not name.startswith('__'):\n            method = getattr(TestRightAngleTriangle, name)\n            suite.addTest(unittest.FunctionTest(method))\n\n    runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()\n    return [test for test in runner.run(suite).tests if not test.wasSuccessful()]\n```\n\nThis modification will iterate through all the methods (including the test methods) defined within the `TestRightAngleTriangle` class and add each individual method to the suite using the `FunctionTest()` method instead of adding the entire class using the deprecated `makeSuite()` method.\n\nAfter updating your code, try running it again:\n\n```bash\npython complete_right_angle_triangle.py\n```\n\nThis should now print the input, expected result, and actual result for any test case that failed during execution, which will help you understand why the test is failing and find a solution to correct the issue in your implementation of `right_angle_triangle()`.",
