Check if there are any edge cases or special conditions that should be considered but might not be in our test data (such as input validation).\n3. Consult external resources, such as textbooks or online forums, for guidance on similar problems with right-angled triangles.\n4. Refactor the existing unit tests to cover additional edge cases and boundary values.\n5. If necessary, add new unit tests that cover different types of input combinations (e.g., negative numbers, zero values).\n6. Thoroughly review all test cases and their results to ensure we understand why some are failing and what adjustments need to be made to our code or tests.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to identify any logical errors in the function or any issues with the unit tests, ultimately leading to a correct implementation of the `right_angle_triangle` function.",
