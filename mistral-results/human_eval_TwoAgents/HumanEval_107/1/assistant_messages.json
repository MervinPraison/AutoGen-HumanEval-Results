            "content": " Based on your execution result, it appears that some of the tests are failing. Let's revisit our assumption and implement a more systematic approach to generate even and odd palindromic numbers:\n\n1. Even Palindromic Numbers: We already have a correct formula to calculate the number of even palindromic numbers within a given range (n(n+1)/2).\n2. Odd Palindromic Numbers: We've attempted to count odd palindromic numbers using the sum of odd squares but seem to be missing something. Let's consider the following facts:\n   - An odd palindromic number is either a perfect square of an odd integer or the reverse of an odd number multiplied by 11 (e.g., 3, 153 = 3^2 and 1631 = 11 * 163).\n   - Only odd digits can be repeated in the middle for a palindromic number (e.g., 313 = 3 * 100 + 1 * 100 + 3 and 161 is also a palindrome).\n\nUsing this knowledge, we'll modify our implementation to better handle odd palindromic numbers. Let's give it a try with the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\nimport math\n\ndef even_odd_palindrome(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd\n    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.\n\n    Example 1:\n\n        Input: 3\n        Output: (1, 2)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.\n\n    Example 2:\n\n        Input: 12\n        Output: (4, 6)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.\n\n    Note:\n        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3\n        2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Count even palindromic numbers using an formula: n(n+1)/2\n    even_palindromes = (n * (n + 1) // 2)\n\n    # Calculate odd palindromic numbers based on perfect squares and reversed odd integers within the range\n    odd_square_sum = sum([i**2 for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n))+1) if i % 2 != 0])\n\n    # If n is a palindromic number itself, it will also be counted as an odd palindromic number. Add it to the count only once (e.g., 149 = 11 * 14 + 1)\n    odd_palindromes = (odd_square_sum // 2) if int(math.pow(10, math.floor(math.log10(n))) % 2 != 0 else odd_square_sum // 2 + 1\n\n    # Return tuple with count of even and odd palindromic numbers within the range (1, n]\n    return (even_palindromes, odd_palindromes)\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(even_odd_palindrome)\n```\n\nThis new approach should resolve any test failure issues you've encountered.
