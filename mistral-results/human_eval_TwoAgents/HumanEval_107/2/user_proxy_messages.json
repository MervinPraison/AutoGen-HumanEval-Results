            "content": " To complete the implementation of `even_odd_palindrome`, we need to count the number of even and odd palindromes within the given range. Here's how you can do it:\n\nFirst, let's define a helper function `is_palindrome` that checks whether a given number is a palindrome or not:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the given positive integer n is a palindrome.\n    \"\"\"\n    return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]\n```\n\nNow we'll modify `even_odd_palindrome` to count even and odd palindromes:\n\n```python\ndef even_odd_palindrome(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd\n    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.\n\n    Example 1:\n\n        Input: 3\n        Output: (1, 2)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.\n\n    Example 2:\n\n        Input: 12\n        Output: (4, 6)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.\n\n    Note:\n        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3\n        2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize counters for even and odd palindromes\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate through the range (1, n+1) to count even and odd palindromes\n    for num in range(1, n+1):\n        if is_palindrome(num):\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                even_count += 1\n            else:\n                odd_count += 1\n\n    # Return a tuple with the number of even and odd palindromes\n    return even_count, odd_count\n```\n\nNow your complete code will look like this:\n\n```python\n# filename: complete_code.py\n\ndef is_palindrome(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the given positive integer n is a palindrome.\n    \"\"\"\n    return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]\n\ndef even_odd_palindrome(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd\n    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.\n\n    Example 1:\n\n        Input: 3\n        Output: (1, 2)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.\n\n    Example 2:\n\n        Input: 12\n        Output: (4, 6)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.\n\n    Note:\n        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3\n        2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize counters for even and odd palindromes\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate through the range (1, n+1) to count even and odd palindromes\n    for num in range(1, n+1):\n        if is_palindrome(num):\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                even_count += 1\n            else:\n                odd_count += 1\n\n    # Return a tuple with the number of even and odd palindromes\n    return even_count, odd_count\n\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Run the unit tests\n    run_tests(even_odd_palindrome)\n```\n\nThis code includes the complete definition of `even_odd_palindrome` along with the calls to `is_palindrome` and `run_tests`.
