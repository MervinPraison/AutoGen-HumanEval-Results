When executed, this code block will automatically import the test suite and run all the defined unit tests for the `modp` function. Make sure you have the my_tests.py file in the same directory as this complete_modp.py file before executing the code.\n\nYou can execute the script by running this command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npython complete_modp.py\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, you will see the test results printed in the console if the implementation is correct and all tests pass successfully. If there are any errors or issues with the implementation, the test suite will return error messages to help you understand what needs to be fixed. Once the tests are passing, you can be assured that your `modp` function has been correctly implemented and verified.\n\nTERMINATE",
