Check that your current working directory is the one containing these files. You can do this by running the command `pwd` in your terminal or command prompt before executing your Python script. If the working directory is incorrect, use the command `cd <path_to_your_project>` to navigate to the correct location.\n3. Make sure you have installed all necessary dependencies and that they are present within your virtual environment (if used). In this example, we don't need any additional packages.\n4. Double-check that there are no typos or missing import statements in both `main.py` and `run_tests.py`. You can print the available modules in Python by running: `import sys; print(sys.modules)` to verify if your package is being imported correctly.\n5. Verify the import statement at the beginning of `main.py` is correct: `from tests_package import run_tests as tests`. Make sure that it matches the path to the `run_tests.py` file.\n\nAfter checking these points, try running your code again and see if you encounter any issues or errors.
