Verify if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring of the first word (`a`).\n2. To check for rotations, iterate through the length of the second word (`b`), each time rotating it by one character and checking if the new rotation is a substring of the first word. A rotation can be simulated by taking a substring of the second word from 1 to the end and appending the first character to the end of this substring.\n3. Return `True` if any rotation is a substring of the first word, `False` otherwise.\n\nHere's a step-by-step completion of the function and including the necessary imports and test execution command:\n\n```python\n# filename: completed_cycpattern_check.py\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef cycpattern_check(a, b):\n    \"\"\"You are given 2 words. You need to return True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word.\"\"\"\n    length_b = len(b)\n    for i in range(length_b):\n        b_rotated = b[i:] + b[:i]  # Rotate b\n        if b_rotated in a:  # Check if rotation of b is a substring of a\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(cycpattern_check)\n```\n\nThis code takes the partially implemented `cycpattern_check` function and fills in the missing logic to verify if any rotation of the second word is a substring of the first word. It completes the function by considering all possible rotations of the second word and checking if any of these rotations are contained within the first word. After completing the function as described, the last line of the script runs the unit tests on the `cycpattern_check` function to ensure it behaves as expected.",
