SCENARIO.PY STARTING !#!#
user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `sort_array`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `sort_array`. However, `sort_array` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `sort_array` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(sort_array)`, as well as sort_array's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def sort_array(array):
    """
    Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting,
    you will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd,
    or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.

    Note:
    * don't change the given array.

    Examples:
    * sort_array([]) => []
    * sort_array([5]) => [5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]) => [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
    """



# Run the unit tests
