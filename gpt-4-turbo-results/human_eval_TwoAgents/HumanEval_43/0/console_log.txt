SCENARIO.PY STARTING !#!#
user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `pairs_sum_to_zero`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `pairs_sum_to_zero`. However, `pairs_sum_to_zero` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `pairs_sum_to_zero` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(pairs_sum_to_zero)`, as well as pairs_sum_to_zero's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
    False
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
    False
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
    False
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7])
    True
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1])
    False
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(pairs_sum_to_zero)
```

This code block contains your function `pairs_sum_to_zero` with a completed implementation that checks for pairs in a list that sum to zero. It also includes the necessary imports to run the unit tests using the `run_tests` function from the `my_tests.py` file. Save this code to a Python file and run it to perform the tests.
