SCENARIO.PY STARTING !#!#
user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `monotonic`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `monotonic`. However, `monotonic` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `monotonic` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(monotonic)`, as well as monotonic's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests



def monotonic(l: list):
    """Return True is list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
    >>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
    True
    >>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
    False
    >>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
    True
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(monotonic)
```
