The\n    strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase\n    letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters \n    in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. \n    You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this \n    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.\n    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should\n    choose the one that comes first in the list.\n    For example, if you are given \"Slices\" as the class and a list of the\n    extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should\n    return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension \n    (its strength is -1).\n    Example:\n    for Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'\n    \"\"\"\n\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(Strongest_Extension)\n```\n",

            "content": "To complete the implementation of `Strongest_Extension` and run the tests as specified, we need to modify the function to compute the strength of each extension correctly. The strength calculation is based on the difference between the count of uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension name. Then, among all extensions, we need to find the one with the highest strength value (where a higher count of uppercase letters compared to lowercase represents stronger strength). If there are multiple extensions with the same highest strength, the first in the list should be selected.\n\nHere's the complete standalone code block that includes everything:\n\n```python\n# filename: complete_implementation.py\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):\n    def extension_strength(extension):\n        uppercase_count = sum(1 for c in extension if c.isupper())\n        lowercase_count = sum(1 for c in extension if c.islower())\n        return uppercase_count - lowercase_count\n\n    strongest_extension = max(extensions, key=lambda ext: (extension_strength(ext), -extensions.index(ext)))\n    return f\"{class_name}.{strongest_extension}\"\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(Strongest_Extension)\n```\n\nThis code defines the `Strongest_Extension` function as required. It includes a nested helper function `extension_strength` to calculate the strength of each extension based on the criteria provided. Then, it uses the built-in `max` function combined with a custom key function to find the extension with the maximum strength. This key not only considers the strength but also maintains the original ordering for extensions with equal strength by subtracting the index (so that lower indices, i.e., elements that appear earlier in the list, have precedence). This complete code block should be saved in a Python script and can be run directly to execute the tests.",
