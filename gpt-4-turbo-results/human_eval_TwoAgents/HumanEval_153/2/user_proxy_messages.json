This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the\ncorrect implementation of `Strongest_Extension`. However, `Strongest_Extension` is only partially\nimplemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `Strongest_Extension` and output\na new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing\n`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(Strongest_Extension)`, as well as Strongest_Extension's complete definition,\nsuch that this code block can be run directly in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):\n    \"\"\"You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.\n    The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The\n    strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase\n    letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters \n    in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. \n    You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this \n    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.\n    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should\n    choose the one that comes first in the list.\n    For example, if you are given \"Slices\" as the class and a list of the\n    extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should\n    return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension \n    (its strength is -1).\n    Example:\n    for Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'\n    \"\"\"\n\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(Strongest_Extension)\n```\n",
