SCENARIO.PY STARTING !#!#
user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `encode`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `encode`. However, `encode` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `encode` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(encode)`, as well as encode's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def encode(message):
    """
    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a 
    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in 
    the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that 
    vowel in the english alphabet. 
    Assume only letters. 
    
    Examples:
    >>> encode('test')
    'TGST'
    >>> encode('This is a message')
    'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(encode)
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

To complete the `encode` function as described, I will implement the function following these steps:

1. Swap the case for each character.
2. Replace vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the English alphabet. The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' for lowercase and their uppercase counterparts. The replacements are:
   - 'a' becomes 'c'
   - 'e' becomes 'g'
   - 'i' becomes 'k'
   - 'o' becomes 'q'
   - 'u' becomes 'w'
   And the same for uppercase variants.
3. Ensure that the character is only replaced if it is a letter.

Now, integrating these steps into the `encode` function and including it with the `run_tests(encode)` call, the complete code block is:

```python
# filename: complete_encode.py
from my_tests import run_tests

def encode(message):
    """
    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a 
    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in 
    the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that 
    vowel in the English alphabet. 
    Assume only letters. 
    
    Examples:
    >>> encode('test')
    'TGST'
    >>> encode('This is a message')
    'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
    """
    vowel_map = {
        'a': 'c',
        'e': 'g',
        'i': 'k',
        'o': 'q',
        'u': 'w',
        'A': 'C',
        'E': 'G',
        'I': 'K',
        'O': 'Q',
        'U': 'W'
    }
    
    encoded_message = []
    
    for character in message:
        if character.isalpha():
            swapped_case = character.swapcase()
            encoded_message.append(vowel_map.get(swapped_case, swapped_case))
        else:
            encoded_message.append(character)
            
    return ''.join(encoded_message)

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(encode)
```

This code should be saved as a `.py` file and run in a Python environment. It includes the complete `encode` function as required and the call to `run_tests(encode)` to verify its correctness.
