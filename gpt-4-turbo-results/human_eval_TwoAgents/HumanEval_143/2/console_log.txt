SCENARIO.PY STARTING !#!#
user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `words_in_sentence`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `words_in_sentence`. However, `words_in_sentence` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `words_in_sentence` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(words_in_sentence)`, as well as words_in_sentence's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

    Example 1:
        Input: sentence = "This is a test"
        Output: "is"

    Example 2:
        Input: sentence = "lets go for swimming"
        Output: "go for"

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
        * sentence contains only letters
    """



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(words_in_sentence)
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

Here is the complete implementation of `words_in_sentence` that fulfills the given requirements, alongside the necessary imports and the test invocation. This updated code checks whether the length of each word is a prime number and returns those words maintaining their original order.

```python
# filename: complete_code.py
from my_tests import run_tests

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    Given a string representing a sentence, returns a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers. The order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.
    """
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Filter words where word length is prime
    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    
    # Join and return those words
    return " ".join(prime_length_words)

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(words_in_sentence)
```

This code includes a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a given number is prime, which is utilized in `words_in_sentence` to filter words by prime lengths. The defined function `words_in_sentence` splits the input sentence into words, filters those with prime lengths, and joins them back into a string to be returned. Running `run_tests(words_in_sentence)` will execute the unit tests provided in `my_tests.py` to validate the implementation.
