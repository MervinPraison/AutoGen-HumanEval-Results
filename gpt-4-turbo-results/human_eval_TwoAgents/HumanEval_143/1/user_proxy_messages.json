Below is the provided code with the function `words_in_sentence` fully implemented. The solution:\n\n1. Splits the sentence into words.\n2. Checks if the length of each word is a prime number.\n3. Compiles and returns a sentence consisting only of words with prime number lengths.\n\nHere is the complete code including the function definition, prime number check, and test invocation.\n\n```python\n# filename: complete_code.py\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is a prime number.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a string representing a sentence,\n    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,\n    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,\n    whose lengths are prime numbers,\n    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.\n    \"\"\"\n    words = sentence.split(' ')\n    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]\n    return ' '.join(prime_length_words)\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(words_in_sentence)\n```\n\nThis revised code completes the `words_in_sentence` function by incorporating the `is_prime` helper function to filter words based on the primality of their lengths and then reassembles those words back into a sentence.
