            "content": "First, let's complete the implementation of `words_in_sentence` by considering the requirements. We need to:\n\n1. Split the input sentence into words.\n2. Check if the length of each word is a prime number.\n3. Collect words with prime length in the same order.\n4. Join these words into a single string and return it.\n\nTo check if a length is a prime number, we'll create a helper function `is_prime` that returns `True` if a number is prime and `False` otherwise.\n\nHere's the completed Python code including the definition of `words_in_sentence` and the necessary import and function call to `run_tests(words_in_sentence)`:\n\n```python\n# filename: final_code.py\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is a prime number.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a string that contains the words from the input sentence,\n    whose lengths are prime numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split input sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Filter words where length of each word is a prime number\n    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]\n    \n    # Join these words into a string and return\n    return ' '.join(prime_length_words)\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(words_in_sentence)\n```\n\nThis code should now be fully functional for your needs. You can save it to a file and run it to perform the tests on the `words_in_sentence` function.",
