This version of the code includes a complete implementation of the `greatest_common_divisor` function. The Euclidean algorithm is used here for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers a and b. It works by repeatedly substituting the larger number with the remainder of dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder becomes 0. At that point, the non-zero number is the GCD of the original pair of numbers. This is an efficient and time-tested method for calculating the GCD.",
