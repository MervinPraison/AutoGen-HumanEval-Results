SCENARIO.PY STARTING !#!#
user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `right_angle_triangle`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `right_angle_triangle`. However, `right_angle_triangle` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `right_angle_triangle` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(right_angle_triangle)`, as well as right_angle_triangle's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(right_angle_triangle)
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

To complete the implementation of `right_angle_triangle`, we need to verify if the triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) can form a right-angled triangle. This can be done by checking the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This condition should be checked for all combinations of sides because we don't know which one is the hypotenuse in the input.

Here's the updated code block with the complete definition of `right_angle_triangle` and everything else needed to run the tests:

```python
# filename: complete_code.py
from my_tests import run_tests


def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    # Sorting the sides ensures the largest (potential hypotenuse) is last
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    # Checking the Pythagorean theorem
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2

# Run the unit tests
run_tests(right_angle_triangle)
```

This solution sorts the sides of the triangle in ascending order, so we can easily apply the Pythagorean theorem (the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side) to check if a triangle is a right-angle triangle. This approach takes into account that the input sides can be in any order.
