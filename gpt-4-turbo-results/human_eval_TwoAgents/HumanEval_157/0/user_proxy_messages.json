            "content": "To complete the implementation of `right_angle_triangle`, we need to verify if the triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) can form a right-angled triangle. This can be done by checking the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This condition should be checked for all combinations of sides because we don't know which one is the hypotenuse in the input.\n\nHere's the updated code block with the complete definition of `right_angle_triangle` and everything else needed to run the tests:\n\n```python\n# filename: complete_code.py\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n    '''\n    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three\n    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.\n    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or \n    90 degree.\n    Example:\n    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True\n    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False\n    '''\n    # Sorting the sides ensures the largest (potential hypotenuse) is last\n    sides = sorted([a, b, c])\n    # Checking the Pythagorean theorem\n    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(right_angle_triangle)\n```\n\nThis solution sorts the sides of the triangle in ascending order, so we can easily apply the Pythagorean theorem (the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side) to check if a triangle is a right-angle triangle. This approach takes into account that the input sides can be in any order.",
