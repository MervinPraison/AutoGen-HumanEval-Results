SCENARIO.PY STARTING !#!#
user_proxy (to assistant):


The following python code imports the `run_tests(candidate)` function from my_tests.py, and runs
it on the function `right_angle_triangle`. This will run a set of automated unit tests to verify the
correct implementation of `right_angle_triangle`. However, `right_angle_triangle` is only partially
implemented in the code below. Complete the implementation of `right_angle_triangle` and output
a new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing
`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(right_angle_triangle)`, as well as right_angle_triangle's complete definition,
such that this code block can be run directly in Python.

```python
from my_tests import run_tests


def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''



# Run the unit tests
run_tests(right_angle_triangle)
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

To implement the `right_angle_triangle` function, we need to verify if the given sides of a triangle adhere to the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem states that for a triangle to be a right-angled triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\) (the shorter two) and \(c\) (the longest side), the following must hold true:

\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\]

Since the input does not guarantee the order of the sides, we need to first figure out which one is the longest side (hypotenuse) and then apply the Pythagorean theorem. I'll now provide the complete code with `right_angle_triangle` properly implemented and set up for testing with your `my_tests.py` module.

```python
# filename: complete_triangle_test.py
from my_tests import run_tests

def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    # Sort the sides to ensure 'c' represents the longest side
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    
    # Apply the Pythagorean theorem
    if sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2:
        return True
    else:
        return False


# Run the unit tests
run_tests(right_angle_triangle)
```

This code block needs to be saved in a single Python file (e.g., `complete_triangle_test.py`) and run in an environment where `my_tests.py` is accessible, as it depends on importing the `run_tests` function from that module. Please, ensure `my_tests.py` is in the same directory or properly referenced in the Python path before running this script.
