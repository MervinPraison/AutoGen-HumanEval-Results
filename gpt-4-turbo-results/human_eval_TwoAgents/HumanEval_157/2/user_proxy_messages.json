Complete the implementation of `right_angle_triangle` and output\na new stand-alone code block that contains everything needed to run the tests, including: importing\n`my_tests`, calling `run_tests(right_angle_triangle)`, as well as right_angle_triangle's complete definition,\nsuch that this code block can be run directly in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\n\ndef right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n    '''\n    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three\n    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.\n    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or \n    90 degree.\n    Example:\n    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True\n    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False\n    '''\n\n\n\n# Run the unit tests\nrun_tests(right_angle_triangle)\n```\n",

            "content": "To implement the `right_angle_triangle` function, we need to verify if the given sides of a triangle adhere to the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem states that for a triangle to be a right-angled triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\) (the shorter two) and \\(c\\) (the longest side), the following must hold true:\n\n\\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\]\n\nSince the input does not guarantee the order of the sides, we need to first figure out which one is the longest side (hypotenuse) and then apply the Pythagorean theorem. I'll now provide the complete code with `right_angle_triangle` properly implemented and set up for testing with your `my_tests.py` module.\n\n```python\n# filename: complete_triangle_test.py\nfrom my_tests import run_tests\n\ndef right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n    '''\n    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
